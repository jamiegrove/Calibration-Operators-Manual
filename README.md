# Calibration-Operators-Manual
An update to the calibration operator procedures for SNO+

Suggestions/Issues/Plans

Front Matter, (title page, linked table of contents) needs to be added.

May need to re-assess organisation of sections

Test test

## 2. Controls
- needs to be updated for the current calibration computer
- login information (passwords?)
- manmon (for external systems)

## 3. Manipulator
- needs update for hanger/bellows systems
- external systems (possibly) need to be highlighted
- double check that the computer system description is up to date

## 4. Manipulator Geometry
- Review "Global Coordinate System"
  - are all of the tables complete?
  - are they still correct?
- Does the context of the global geometry still make sense
  - Going from a UI mounted system to a I-beam mounted system
  - Should calibration system be defined wrt the PSUP
- Glovebox and UI description should be borrowed from the detector paper (early drafts)

## 5. Calibration Gas Systems
- Will need to have some comments about the cover gas system
- Specifications and UI cover gas monitoring will be required
  - Borrow from the detector paper and the TWiki
- Plans for URM cover gas required
- Comments on background mitigations and radon requirements

## 6. Laser
- Is the existing documentation sufficient
- Super Nova Calibration source?

## 7. Sources
- Need Scintillator sources (Laserball AmBe, Tagged, Untagged and Cherekov sources)
- Need external source specifications (AmBe, N16, Laserball)

## 8. Procedures
- Should separate Water Only, Scintillator Only, External and Generally applicable procedures into different sections
- Water Only
  - Mounting procedures
  - Internal N16 deployment
- External Deployment Procedures (Needs to be brought up to standards)
  - Mounting procedures (to be written)
  - N16
  - AmBe
  - Laserball 
- Scintillator (with adjustments)
  - Mounting procedures
  - Pump/purge procedures 
  - Cover gas maintenance
  - Source handling
  - AmBe / Encapsulated deployments (adapted from water) 
  - Cherenkov deployment (adapted from water)
  - Laserball deployments (adapted from water) 
- Applicable to all
  - Supernova source
  - DT generator
  - Laser procedures
  
## 9. Deployment Records?
- Would it be worth recording Run numbers, dates, run plans in the operators manual for future reference?
- Limit to one page summaries
